gives you a rounding error in the floating Point synthetic intelligences are kind of like the next stage of development and I don't know where it leads to like at some point I suspect the universe is some kind of a puzzle these synthetic AIS will uncover that puzzle and solve it the following is a conversation with Andre capothy previously the director of AI at Tesla and before that at open Ai and Stanford he is one of the greatest scientists engineers and Educators in the history of artificial intelligence this is the Lex Friedman podcast to support it please check out our sponsors and now dear friends here's Andre capathi what is a neural network and why does it seem to uh do such a surprisingly good job of learning what is a neural network it's a mathematical abstraction of the brain I would say that's how it was originally developed at the end of the day it's a mathematical expression and it's a fairly simple mathematical expression when you get down to it it's basically a sequence of Matrix multiplies which are really dot products mathematically and some nonlinearities thrown in and so it's a very simple mathematical expression and it's got knobs in it many knobs many knobs and these knobs are Loosely related to basically the synapses in your brain they're trainable they're modifiable and so the idea is like we need to find the setting of The Knobs that makes the neural nut do whatever you want it to do like classify images and so on and so there's not too much mystery I would say in it like um you might think that basically don't want to endow it with too much meaning with respect to the brain and how it works it's really just a complicated mathematical expression with knobs and those knobs need a proper setting for it to do something uh desirable yeah but poetry is just the collection of letters with spaces but it can make us feel a certain way and in that same way when you get a large number of knobs together whether it's in a inside the brain or inside a computer they seem to they seem to surprise us with the with their power yeah I think that's fair so basically I'm underselling it by a lot because you definitely do get very surprising emergent behaviors out of these neurons when they're large enough and trained on complicated enough problems like say for example the next uh word prediction in a massive data set from the internet and then these neurons take on a pretty surprising magical properties yeah I think it's kind of interesting how much you can get out of even very simple mathematical formalism when your brain right now I was talking is it doing next word prediction or is it doing something more interesting well definitely some kind of a generative model that's a gpt-like and prompted by you um yeah so you're giving me a prompt and I'm kind of like responding to it in a generative way and by yourself perhaps a little bit like are you adding extra prompts from your own memory inside your head automatically feels like you're referencing some kind of a declarative structure of like memory and so on and then uh you're putting that together with your prompt and giving away some messages like how much of what you just said has been said by you before uh nothing basically right no but if you actually look at all the words you've ever said in your life and you do a search you'll probably said a lot of the same words in the same order before yeah it could be I mean I'm using phrases that are common Etc but I'm remixing it into a pretty uh sort of unique sentence at the end of the day but you're right definitely there's like a ton of remixing what you didn't you it's like Magnus Carlsen said uh I'm I'm rated 2900 whatever which is pretty decent I think you're talking very uh you're not giving enough credit to neural Nets here why do they seem to what's your best intuition about this emergent Behavior I mean it's kind of interesting because I'm simultaneously underselling them but I also feel like there's an element to which I'm over like it's actually kind of incredible that you can get so much emergent magical Behavior out of them despite them being so simple mathematically so I think those are kind of like two surprising statements that are kind of just juxtapose together and I think basically what it is is we are actually fairly good at optimizing these neural Nets and when you give them a hard enough problem they are forced to learn very interesting Solutions in the optimization and those solution basically have these immersion properties that are very interesting there's wisdom and knowledge in the knobs and so what's this representation that's in the knobs does it make sense to you intuitively the large number of knobs can hold the representation that captures some deep wisdom about the data it has looked at it's a lot of\"\n",

      "knobs it's a lot of knobs and somehow you know so speaking concretely um one of the neural Nets that people are very excited about right now are are gpts which are basically just next word prediction networks so you consume a sequence of words from the internet and you try to predict the next word and uh once you train these on a large enough data set um they you can basically uh prompt these neural amounts in arbitrary ways and you can ask them to solve problems and they will so you can just tell them you can you can make it look like you're trying to um solve some kind of a mathematical problem and they will continue what they think is the solution based on what they've seen on the internet and very often those Solutions look very remarkably consistent look correct potentially do you still think about the brain side of it so as neural Nets is an abstraction or mathematical abstraction of the brain you still draw wisdom from from the biological neural networks or even the bigger question so you're a big fan of biology and biological computation what impressive thing is biology do doing to you that computers are not yet that Gap I would say I'm definitely on I'm much more hesitant with the analogies to the brain than I think you would see potentially in the field um and I kind of feel like certainly the way neural network started is everything stemmed from inspiration by the brain but at the end of the day the artifacts that you get after training they are arrived at by a very different optimization process than the optimization process that gave rise to the brain and so I think uh I kind of think of it as a very complicated alien artifact um it's something different I'm not sorry the uh the neuralness that we're training okay they are complicated uh Alien artifact uh I do not make analogies to the brain because I think the optimization process that gave rise to it is very different from the brain so there was no multi-agent self-play kind of uh setup uh and evolution it was an optimization that is basically a what amounts to a compression objective on a massive amount of data okay so artificial neural networks are doing compression and biological neural networks are not to survive and they're not really doing any they're they're an agent in a multi-agent self-place system that's been running for a very very long time that said Evolution has found that it is very useful to to predict and have a predictive model in the brain and so I think our brain utilizes something that looks like that as a part of it but it has a lot more you know gadgets and gizmos and uh value functions and ancient nuclei that are all trying to like make a survive and reproduce and everything else and the whole thing through embryogenesis is built from a single cell I mean it's just the code is inside the DNA and it just builds it up like the entire organism yes and like it does it pretty well it should not be possible so there's some learning going on there's some there's some there's some kind of computation going through that building process I mean I I don't know where if you were just to look at the entirety of history of life on Earth where do you think is the most interesting invention is it the origin of life itself is it just jumping to eukaryotes is it mammals is it humans themselves Homo sapiens the the origin of intelligence or highly complex intelligence or or is it all just in continuation the same kind of process certainly I would say it's an extremely remarkable story that I'm only like briefly learning about recently all the way from um actually like you almost have to start at the formation of Earth and all of its conditions and the entire solar system and how everything is arranged with Jupiter and Moon and the habitable zone and everything and then you have an active Earth that's turning over material and um and then you start with a biogenesis and everything and so it's all like a pretty remarkable story I'm not sure that I can pick like a single Unique Piece of it that I find most interesting um I guess for me as an artificial intelligence researcher it's probably the last piece we have lots of animals that uh you know are are not building technological Society but we do and um it seems to have happened very quickly it seems to have happened very recently and uh something very interesting happened there that I don't fully understand I almost understand everything else kind of I think intuitively uh but I don't understand exactly that part and how quick it was both explanations would be interesting one is that this is just a continuation of the same kind of process there's nothing special about humans that would be deeply understanding that would be very interesting that we think of ourselves as special but it was obvious all it was already written in the in the code that you would have greater and greater intelligence emerging and then the other explanation which is something truly special happened something like a rare event whether it's like crazy rare event like uh Space Odyssey what would it be see if you say like the invention of Fire or the uh as Richard rangham says the\n",

      "drops off as basically one over R square uh so I remember reading that our current radio waves would not be uh the ones that we we are broadcasting would not be uh measurable by our devices today only like was it like one tenth of a light year away like not even basically tiny distance because you really need like a targeted transmission of massive power directed somewhere for this to be picked up on long distances and so I just think that our ability to measure is um is not amazing I think there's probably other civilizations out there and then the big question is why don't they build binomial probes and why don't they Interstellar travel across the entire galaxy and my current answer is it's probably Interstellar travel is like really hard uh you have the interstellar medium if you want to move at closer speed of light you're going to be encountering bullets along the way because even like tiny hydrogen atoms and little particles of dust are basically have like massive kinetic energy at those speeds and so basically you need some kind of shielding you need you have all the cosmic radiation uh it's just like brutal out there it's really hard and so my thinking is maybe Interstellar travel is just extremely hard to build hard it feels like uh it feels like we're not a billion years away from doing that it just might be that it's very you have to go very slowly potentially as an example through space um right as opposed to close the speed of light so I'm suspicious basically of our ability to measure life and I'm suspicious of the ability to um just permeate all of space in the Galaxy or across galaxies and that's the only way that I can certainly I can currently see a way around it yeah it's kind of mind-blowing to think that there's trillions of intelligent alien civilizations out there kind of slowly traveling through space to meet each other and some of them meet some of them go to war some of them collaborate or they're all just uh independent they are all just like little pockets I don't know well statistically if there's like if it's there's trillions of them surely some of them some of the pockets are close enough to get some of them happen to be close yeah in the close enough to see each other and then once you see once you see something that is definitely complex life like if we see something yeah we're probably going to be severe like intensely aggressively motivated to figure out what the hell that is and try to meet them what would be your first instinct to try to like at a generational level meet them or defend against them or what would be your uh Instinct as a president of the United States and the scientists I don't know which hat you prefer in this question yeah I think the the question it's really hard um I will say like for example for us um we have lots of primitive life forms on Earth um next to us we have all kinds of ants and everything else and we share space with them and we are hesitant to impact on them and to we are and we're trying to protect them by default because they are amazing interesting dynamical systems that took a long time to evolve and they are interesting and special and I don't know that you want to um destroy that by default and so I like complex dynamical systems that took a lot of time to evolve I think I'd like to I like to preserve it if I can afford to and I'd like to think that the same would be true about uh the galactic resources and that uh they would think that we're kind of incredible interesting story that took time it took a few billion years to unravel and you don't want to just destroy it I could see two aliens talking about Earth right now and saying uh I'm I'm a big fan of complex dynamical systems so I think it was a value to preserve these and who basically are a video game they watch or show a TV show that they watch yeah I think uh you would need like a very good reason I think to to destroy it uh like why don't we destroy these ant farms and so on it's because we're not actually like really in direct competition with them right now uh we do it accidentally and so on but um there's plenty of resources and so why would you destroy something that is so interesting and precious well from a scientific perspective you might probe it yeah you might interact with it later you might want to learn something from it right so I wonder there's could be certain physical phenomena that we think is a physical phenomena but it's actually interacting with us to like poke the finger and see what happens I think it should be very interesting to scientists other alien scientists what happened here um and you know it's a what we're seeing today is a snapshot basically it's a result of a huge amount of computation uh of over like billion years or something like that so it could have been initiated by aliens this could be a computer running a program like when okay if you had the power to do this when you okay for sure at least I would I would pick uh a Earth-like planet that has the\n",

leads to like at some point I suspect the universe is some kind of a puzzle these synthetic AIS will uncover that puzzle and solve it the following is a conversation with Andre capothy previously the director of AI at Tesla and before that at open Ai and Stanford he is one of the greatest scientists engineers and Educators in the history of artificial intelligence this is the Lex Friedman podcast to support it please check out our sponsors and now dear friends here's Andre capathi what is a neural network and why does it seem to uh do such a surprisingly good job of learning what is a neural network it's a mathematical abstraction of the brain I would say that's how it was originally developed at the end of the day it's a mathematical expression and it's a fairly simple mathematical expression when you get down to it it's basically a sequence of Matrix multiplies which are really dot products mathematically and some nonlinearities thrown in and so it's a very simple mathematical expression and it's got knobs in it many knobs many knobs and these knobs are Loosely related to basically the synapses in your brain they're trainable they're modifiable and so the idea is like we need to find the setting of The Knobs that makes the neural nut do whatever you want it to do like classify images and so on and so there's not too much mystery I would say in it like um you might think that basically don't want to endow it with too much meaning with respect to the brain and how it works it's really just a complicated mathematical expression with knobs and those knobs need a proper setting for it to do something uh desirable yeah but poetry is just the collection of letters with spaces but it can make us feel a certain way and in that same way when you get a large number of knobs together whether it's in a inside the brain or inside a computer they seem to they seem to surprise us with the with their power yeah I think that's fair so basically I'm underselling it by a lot because you definitely do get very surprising emergent behaviors out of these neurons when they're large enough and trained on complicated enough problems like say for example the next uh word prediction in a massive data set from the internet and then these neurons take on a pretty surprising magical properties yeah I think it's kind of interesting how much you can get out of even very simple mathematical formalism when your brain right now I was talking is it doing next word prediction or is it doing something more interesting well definitely some kind of a generative model that's a gpt-like and prompted by you um yeah so you're giving me a prompt and I'm kind of like responding to it in a generative way and by yourself perhaps a little bit like are you adding extra prompts from your own memory inside your head automatically feels like you're referencing some kind of a declarative structure of like memory and so on and then uh you're putting that together with your prompt and giving away some messages like how much of what you just said has been said by you before uh nothing basically right no but if you actually look at all the words you've ever said in your life and you do a search you'll probably said a lot of the same words in the same order before yeah it could be I mean I'm using phrases that are common Etc but I'm remixing it into a pretty uh sort of unique sentence at the end of the day but you're right definitely there's like a ton of remixing what you didn't you it's like Magnus Carlsen said uh I'm I'm rated 2900 whatever which is pretty decent I think you're talking very uh you're not giving enough credit to neural Nets here why do they seem to what's your best intuition about this emergent Behavior I mean it's kind of interesting because I'm simultaneously underselling them but I also feel like there's an element to which I'm over like it's actually kind of incredible that you can get so much emergent magical Behavior out of them despite them being so simple mathematically so I think those are kind of like two surprising statements that are kind of just juxtapose together and I think basically what it is is we are actually fairly good at optimizing these neural Nets and when you give them a hard enough problem they are forced to learn very interesting Solutions in the optimization and those solution basically have these immersion properties that are very interesting there's wisdom and knowledge in the knobs and so what's this representation that's in the knobs does it make sense to you intuitively the large number of knobs can hold the representation that captures some deep wisdom about the data it has looked at it's a lot of\"),\n",
      "                     Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"knobs it's a lot of knobs and somehow you know so speaking concretely um one of the neural Nets that people are very excited about right now are are gpts which are basically just next word prediction networks so you consume a sequence of words from the internet and you try to predict the next word and uh once you train these on a large enough data set um they you can basically uh prompt these neural amounts in arbitrary ways and you can ask them to solve problems and they will so you can just tell them you can you can make it look like you're trying to um solve some kind of a mathematical problem and they will continue what they think is the solution based on what they've seen on the internet and very often those Solutions look very remarkably consistent look correct potentially do you still think about the brain side of it so as neural Nets is an abstraction or mathematical abstraction of the brain you still draw wisdom from from the biological neural networks or even the bigger question so you're a big fan of biology and biological computation what impressive thing is biology do doing to you that computers are not yet that Gap I would say I'm definitely on I'm much more hesitant with the analogies to the brain than I think you would see potentially in the field um and I kind of feel like certainly the way neural network started is everything stemmed from inspiration by the brain but at the end of the day the artifacts that you get after training they are arrived at by a very different optimization process than the optimization process that gave rise to the brain and so I think uh I kind of think of it as a very complicated alien artifact um it's something different I'm not sorry the uh the neuralness that we're training okay they are complicated uh Alien artifact uh I do not make analogies to the brain because I think the optimization process that gave rise to it is very different from the brain so there was no multi-agent self-play kind of uh setup uh and evolution it was an optimization that is basically a what amounts to a compression objective on a massive amount of data okay so artificial neural networks are doing compression and biological neural networks are not to survive and they're not really doing any they're they're an agent in a multi-agent self-place system that's been running for a very very long time that said Evolution has found that it is very useful to to predict and have a predictive model in the brain and so I think our brain utilizes something that looks like that as a part of it but it has a lot more you know gadgets and gizmos and uh value functions and ancient nuclei that are all trying to like make a survive and reproduce and everything else and the whole thing through embryogenesis is built from a single cell I mean it's just the code is inside the DNA and it just builds it up like the entire organism yes and like it does it pretty well it should not be possible so there's some learning going on there's some there's some there's some kind of computation going through that building process I mean I I don't know where if you were just to look at the entirety of history of life on Earth where do you think is the most interesting invention is it the origin of life itself is it just jumping to eukaryotes is it mammals is it humans themselves Homo sapiens the the origin of intelligence or highly complex intelligence or or is it all just in continuation the same kind of process certainly I would say it's an extremely remarkable story that I'm only like briefly learning about recently all the way from um actually like you almost have to start at the formation of Earth and all of its conditions and the entire solar system and how everything is arranged with Jupiter and Moon and the habitable zone and everything and then you have an active Earth that's turning over material and um and then you start with a biogenesis and everything and so it's all like a pretty remarkable story I'm not sure that I can pick like a single Unique Piece of it that I find most interesting um I guess for me as an artificial intelligence researcher it's probably the last piece we have lots of animals that uh you know are are not building technological Society but we do and um it seems to have happened very quickly it seems to have happened very recently and uh something very interesting happened there that I don't fully understand I almost understand everything else kind of I think intuitively uh but I don't understand exactly that part and how quick it was both explanations would be interesting one is that this is just a continuation of the same kind of process there's nothing special about humans that would be deeply understanding that would be very interesting that we think of ourselves as special but it was obvious all it was already written in the in the code that you would have greater and greater intelligence emerging and then the other explanation which is something truly special happened something like a rare event whether it's like crazy rare event like uh Space Odyssey what would it be see if you say like the invention of Fire or the uh as Richard rangham says the\"),\n",

rare thing in the universe yeah I'm hesitant to say that it is rare by the way but it definitely seems like it's kind of like a punctuated equilibrium where you have lots of exploration and then you have certain leaps sparse leaps in between so of course like origin of life would be one um you know DNA sex eukaryotic system eukaryotic life um the endosymbiosis event or the archaeon 8 little bacteria you know just the whole thing and then of course emergence of Consciousness and so on so it seems like definitely there are sparse events where mass amount of progress was made but yeah it's kind of hard to pick one so you don't think humans are unique gotta ask you how many intelligent aliens civilizations do you think are out there and uh is there intelligence different or similar to ours yeah I've been preoccupied with this question quite a bit recently uh basically the for me Paradox and just thinking through and and the reason actually that I am very interested in uh the origin of life is fundamentally trying to understand how common it is that there are technological societies out there uh um in space and the more I study it the more I think that um uh there should be quite a few quite a lot why haven't we heard from them because I I agree with you it feels like I just don't see why what we did here on Earth is so difficult to do yeah and especially when you get into the details of it I used to think origin of life was very um it was this magical rare event but then you read books like for example McLean um uh the vital question a life ascending Etc and he really gets in and he really makes you believe that this is not that rare basic chemistry you have an active Earth and you have your alkaline Vents and you have lots of alkaline Waters mixing whether it's a devotion and you have your proton gradients and you have the little porous pockets of these alkaline vents that concentrate chemistry and um basically as he steps through all of these little pieces you start to understand that actually this is not that crazy you could see this happen on other systems um and he really takes you from just a geology to primitive life and he makes it feel like it's actually pretty plausible and also like the origin of life um didn't uh was actually fairly fast after formation of Earth um if I remember correctly just a few hundred million years or something like that after basically when it was possible life actually arose and so that makes me feel like that is not the constraint that is not the limiting variable and that life should actually be fairly common um and then it you know where the drop-offs are is very um is very interesting to think about I currently think that there's no major drop-offs basically and so there should be quite a lot of life and basically what it where that brings me to then is the only way to reconcile the fact that we haven't found anyone and so on is that um we just can't we can't see them we can't observe them just a quick brief comment Nick Lane and a lot of biologists I talked to they really seem to think that the jump from bacteria to more complex organisms is the hardest jump the eukaryotic glyphosis yeah which I don't I get it they're much more knowledgeable uh than me about like the intricacies of biology but that seems like crazy because how much how many single cell organisms are there like and how much time you have surely it's not that difficult like in a billion years it's not even that long of a time really just all these bacteria under constrained resources battling it out I'm sure they can invent more complex again I don't understand it's like how to move from a hello world program to like like invent a function or something like that I don't yeah I I so I don't yeah so I'm with you I just feel like I don't see any if the origin of life that would be my intuition that's the hardest thing but if that's not the hardest thing because it happens so quickly then it's got to be everywhere and yeah maybe we're just too dumb to see it well it's just we don't have really good mechanisms for seeing this life I mean uh by what how um so I'm not an expert just to preface this but just said it was I want to meet an expert on alien intelligence and how to communicate I'm very suspicious of our ability to to find these intelligences out there and to find these Earths like radio waves for example are are terrible uh their power\"),\n",
      "                     Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"drops off as basically one over R square uh so I remember reading that our current radio waves would not be uh the ones that we we are broadcasting would not be uh measurable by our devices today only like was it like one tenth of a light year away like not even basically tiny distance because you really need like a targeted transmission of massive power directed somewhere for this to be picked up on long distances and so I just think that our ability to measure is um is not amazing I think there's probably other civilizations out there and then the big question is why don't they build binomial probes and why don't they Interstellar travel across the entire galaxy and my current answer is it's probably Interstellar travel is like really hard uh you have the interstellar medium if you want to move at closer speed of light you're going to be encountering bullets along the way because even like tiny hydrogen atoms and little particles of dust are basically have like massive kinetic energy at those speeds and so basically you need some kind of shielding you need you have all the cosmic radiation uh it's just like brutal out there it's really hard and so my thinking is maybe Interstellar travel is just extremely hard to build hard it feels like uh it feels like we're not a billion years away from doing that it just might be that it's very you have to go very slowly potentially as an example through space um right as opposed to close the speed of light so I'm suspicious basically of our ability to measure life and I'm suspicious of the ability to um just permeate all of space in the Galaxy or across galaxies and that's the only way that I can certainly I can currently see a way around it yeah it's kind of mind-blowing to think that there's trillions of intelligent alien civilizations out there kind of slowly traveling through space to meet each other and some of them meet some of them go to war some of them collaborate or they're all just uh independent they are all just like little pockets I don't know well statistically if there's like if it's there's trillions of them surely some of them some of the pockets are close enough to get some of them happen to be close yeah in the close enough to see each other and then once you see once you see something that is definitely complex life like if we see something yeah we're probably going to be severe like intensely aggressively motivated to figure out what the hell that is and try to meet them what would be your first instinct to try to like at a generational level meet them or defend against them or what would be your uh Instinct as a president of the United States and the scientists I don't know which hat you prefer in this question yeah I think the the question it's really hard um I will say like for example for us um we have lots of primitive life forms on Earth um next to us we have all kinds of ants and everything else and we share space with them and we are hesitant to impact on them and to we are and we're trying to protect them by default because they are amazing interesting dynamical systems that took a long time to evolve and they are interesting and special and I don't know that you want to um destroy that by default and so I like complex dynamical systems that took a lot of time to evolve I think I'd like to I like to preserve it if I can afford to and I'd like to think that the same would be true about uh the galactic resources and that uh they would think that we're kind of incredible interesting story that took time it took a few billion years to unravel and you don't want to just destroy it I could see two aliens talking about Earth right now and saying uh I'm I'm a big fan of complex dynamical systems so I think it was a value to preserve these and who basically are a video game they watch or show a TV show that they watch yeah I think uh you would need like a very good reason I think to to destroy it uh like why don't we destroy these ant farms and so on it's because we're not actually like really in direct competition with them right now uh we do it accidentally and so on but um there's plenty of resources and so why would you destroy something that is so interesting and precious well from a scientific perspective you might probe it yeah you might interact with it later you might want to learn something from it right so I wonder there's could be certain physical phenomena that we think is a physical phenomena but it's actually interacting with us to like poke the finger and see what happens I think it should be very interesting to scientists other alien scientists what happened here um and you know it's a what we're seeing today is a snapshot basically it's a result of a huge amount of computation uh of over like billion years or something like that so it could have been initiated by aliens this could be a computer running a program like when okay if you had the power to do this when you okay for sure at least I would I would pick uh a Earth-like planet that has the\"),\n",
      "                     Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"conditions based my understanding of the chemistry prerequisites for life and I would see it with life and run it right like yeah wouldn't you 100 do that and observe it and then protect I mean that that's not just a hell of a good TV show it's it's a good scientific experiment yeah and that in his it's physical simulation right maybe maybe the evolution is the most like actually running it uh is the most efficient way to uh understand computation or to compute stuff or to understand life or you know what life looks like and uh what branches it can take it does make me kind of feel weird that we're part of a science experiment but maybe it's everything's a science experiments how to does that change anything for us for a science experiment um I don't know two descendants of Apes talking about being inside of a science experience I'm suspicious of this idea of like a deliberate Pence Premiere as you described it service and I don't see a divine intervention in some way in the in the historical record right now I do feel like um the story in these in these books like Nick Lane's books and so on sort of makes sense uh and it makes sense how life arose on Earth uniquely and uh yeah I don't need a I need I don't need to reach for more exotic explanations right now sure but NPCs inside a video game don't don't don't observe any divine intervention either and we might just be all NPCs running a kind of code maybe eventually they will currently NPCs are really dumb but once they're running gpts um maybe they will be like hey this is really suspicious what the hell so you uh famously tweeted it looks like if you bombard Earth with photons for a while you can emit A roadster so if like an Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy we would summarize the story of Earth so in in that book it's mostly harmless uh what do you think is all the possible stories like a paragraph long or a sentence long that Earth could be summarized as once it's done it's computation so like all the Possible full if Earth is a book right yeah uh probably there has to be an ending I mean there's going to be an end to Earth and it could end in all kinds of ways it could end soon it can end later what do you think are the possible stories well definitely there seems to be yeah you're sort of it's pretty incredible that these self-replicating systems will basically arise from the Dynamics and then they perpetuate themselves and become more complex and eventually become conscious and build a society and I kind of feel like in some sense it's kind of like a deterministic wave uh that you know that kind of just like happens on any you know any sufficiently well arranged system like Earth and so I kind of feel like there's a certain sense of inevitability in it um and it's really beautiful and it ends somehow right so it's a it's a chemically a diverse environment where complex dynamical systems can evolve and become more more further and further complex but then there's a certain um what is it there's certain terminating conditions yeah I don't know what the terminating conditions are but definitely there's a trend line of something and we're part of that story and like where does that where does it go so you know we're famously described often as a biological Bootloader for AIS and that's because humans I mean you know we're an incredible uh biological system and we're capable of computation and uh you know and love and so on um but we're extremely inefficient as well like we're talking to each other through audio it's just kind of embarrassing honestly they were manipulating like seven symbols uh serially we're using vocal chords it's all happening over like multiple seconds yeah it's just like kind of embarrassing when you step down to the uh frequencies at which computers operate or are able to cooperate on and so basically it does seem like um synthetic intelligences are kind of like the next stage of development and um I don't know where it leads to like at some point I suspect uh the universe is some kind of a puzzle and these synthetic AIS will uncover that puzzle and um solve it and then what happens after right like what because if you just like Fast Forward Earth many billions of years it's like uh it's quiet and then it's like to tourmal you see like city lights and stuff like that and then what happens like at the end like is it like a is it or is it like a calming is it explosion is it like Earth like open like a giant because you said emit Roasters like well let's start emitting like like a giant number of Like Satellites yes it's some kind of a crazy explosion and we're living we're like we're stepping through a explosion and we're like living day to day and it doesn't look like it but it's actually if you I saw a very cool animation of Earth uh and life on Earth and basically nothing happens for a long time and then the last like two seconds like basically cities and everything and\")],\n",

gives you a rounding error in the floating Point synthetic intelligences are kind of like the next stage of development and I don't know where it leads to like at some point I suspect the universe is some kind of a puzzle these synthetic AIS will uncover that puzzle and solve it the following is a conversation with Andre capothy previously the director of AI at Tesla and before that at open Ai and Stanford he is one of the greatest scientists engineers and Educators in the history of artificial intelligence this is the Lex Friedman podcast to support it please check out our sponsors and now dear friends here's Andre capathi what is a neural network and why does it seem to uh do such a surprisingly good job of learning what is a neural network it's a mathematical abstraction of the brain I would say that's how it was originally developed at the end of the day it's a mathematical expression and it's a fairly simple mathematical expression when you get down to it it's basically a sequence of Matrix multiplies which are really dot products mathematically and some nonlinearities thrown in and so it's a very simple mathematical expression and it's got knobs in it many knobs many knobs and these knobs are Loosely related to basically the synapses in your brain they're trainable they're modifiable and so the idea is like we need to find the setting of The Knobs that makes the neural nut do whatever you want it to do like classify images and so on and so there's not too much mystery I would say in it like um you might think that basically don't want to endow it with too much meaning with respect to the brain and how it works it's really just a complicated mathematical expression with knobs and those knobs need a proper setting for it to do something uh desirable yeah but poetry is just the collection of letters with spaces but it can make us feel a certain way and in that same way when you get a large number of knobs together whether it's in a inside the brain or inside a computer they seem to they seem to surprise us with the with their power yeah I think that's fair so basically I'm underselling it by a lot because you definitely do get very surprising emergent behaviors out of these neurons when they're large enough and trained on complicated enough problems like say for example the next uh word prediction in a massive data set from the internet and then these neurons take on a pretty surprising magical properties yeah I think it's kind of interesting how much you can get out of even very simple mathematical formalism when your brain right now I was talking is it doing next word prediction or is it doing something more interesting well definitely some kind of a generative model that's a gpt-like and prompted by you um yeah so you're giving me a prompt and I'm kind of like responding to it in a generative way and by yourself perhaps a little bit like are you adding extra prompts from your own memory inside your head automatically feels like you're referencing some kind of a declarative structure of like memory and so on and then uh you're putting that together with your prompt and giving away some messages like how much of what you just said has been said by you before uh nothing basically right no but if you actually look at all the words you've ever said in your life and you do a search you'll probably said a lot of the same words in the same order before yeah it could be I mean I'm using phrases that are common Etc but I'm remixing it into a pretty uh sort of unique sentence at the end of the day but you're right definitely there's like a ton of remixing what you didn't you it's like Magnus Carlsen said uh I'm I'm rated 2900 whatever which is pretty decent I think you're talking very uh you're not giving enough credit to neural Nets here why do they seem to what's your best intuition about this emergent Behavior I mean it's kind of interesting because I'm simultaneously underselling them but I also feel like there's an element to which I'm over like it's actually kind of incredible that you can get so much emergent magical Behavior out of them despite them being so simple mathematically so I think those are kind of like two surprising statements that are kind of just juxtapose together and I think basically what it is is we are actually fairly good at optimizing these neural Nets and when you give them a hard enough problem they are forced to learn very interesting Solutions in the optimization and those solution basically have these immersion properties that are very interesting there's wisdom and knowledge in the knobs and so what's this representation that's in the knobs does it make sense to you intuitively the large number of knobs can hold the representation that captures some deep wisdom about the data it has looked at it's a lot of\"\n",

      "knobs it's a lot of knobs and somehow you know so speaking concretely um one of the neural Nets that people are very excited about right now are are gpts which are basically just next word prediction networks so you consume a sequence of words from the internet and you try to predict the next word and uh once you train these on a large enough data set um they you can basically uh prompt these neural amounts in arbitrary ways and you can ask them to solve problems and they will so you can just tell them you can you can make it look like you're trying to um solve some kind of a mathematical problem and they will continue what they think is the solution based on what they've seen on the internet and very often those Solutions look very remarkably consistent look correct potentially do you still think about the brain side of it so as neural Nets is an abstraction or mathematical abstraction of the brain you still draw wisdom from from the biological neural networks or even the bigger question so you're a big fan of biology and biological computation what impressive thing is biology do doing to you that computers are not yet that Gap I would say I'm definitely on I'm much more hesitant with the analogies to the brain than I think you would see potentially in the field um and I kind of feel like certainly the way neural network started is everything stemmed from inspiration by the brain but at the end of the day the artifacts that you get after training they are arrived at by a very different optimization process than the optimization process that gave rise to the brain and so I think uh I kind of think of it as a very complicated alien artifact um it's something different I'm not sorry the uh the neuralness that we're training okay they are complicated uh Alien artifact uh I do not make analogies to the brain because I think the optimization process that gave rise to it is very different from the brain so there was no multi-agent self-play kind of uh setup uh and evolution it was an optimization that is basically a what amounts to a compression objective on a massive amount of data okay so artificial neural networks are doing compression and biological neural networks are not to survive and they're not really doing any they're they're an agent in a multi-agent self-place system that's been running for a very very long time that said Evolution has found that it is very useful to to predict and have a predictive model in the brain and so I think our brain utilizes something that looks like that as a part of it but it has a lot more you know gadgets and gizmos and uh value functions and ancient nuclei that are all trying to like make a survive and reproduce and everything else and the whole thing through embryogenesis is built from a single cell I mean it's just the code is inside the DNA and it just builds it up like the entire organism yes and like it does it pretty well it should not be possible so there's some learning going on there's some there's some there's some kind of computation going through that building process I mean I I don't know where if you were just to look at the entirety of history of life on Earth where do you think is the most interesting invention is it the origin of life itself is it just jumping to eukaryotes is it mammals is it humans themselves Homo sapiens the the origin of intelligence or highly complex intelligence or or is it all just in continuation the same kind of process certainly I would say it's an extremely remarkable story that I'm only like briefly learning about recently all the way from um actually like you almost have to start at the formation of Earth and all of its conditions and the entire solar system and how everything is arranged with Jupiter and Moon and the habitable zone and everything and then you have an active Earth that's turning over material and um and then you start with a biogenesis and everything and so it's all like a pretty remarkable story I'm not sure that I can pick like a single Unique Piece of it that I find most interesting um I guess for me as an artificial intelligence researcher it's probably the last piece we have lots of animals that uh you know are are not building technological Society but we do and um it seems to have happened very quickly it seems to have happened very recently and uh something very interesting happened there that I don't fully understand I almost understand everything else kind of I think intuitively uh but I don't understand exactly that part and how quick it was both explanations would be interesting one is that this is just a continuation of the same kind of process there's nothing special about humans that would be deeply understanding that would be very interesting that we think of ourselves as special but it was obvious all it was already written in the in the code that you would have greater and greater intelligence emerging and then the other explanation which is something truly special happened something like a rare event whether it's like crazy rare event like uh Space Odyssey what would it be see if you say like the invention of Fire or the uh as Richard rangham says the\n",

      "beta males deciding a clever way to kill the alpha males by collaborating so just optimizing the collaborations really the multi-agent aspect of the multi-agent and that really being constrained on resources and trying to survive the collaboration aspect is what created the complex intelligence but it seems like it's a natural outgrowth of the evolution process like what could possibly be a magical thing that happened like a rare thing that would say that humans are actually human level intelligence is actually a really rare thing in the universe yeah I'm hesitant to say that it is rare by the way but it definitely seems like it's kind of like a punctuated equilibrium where you have lots of exploration and then you have certain leaps sparse leaps in between so of course like origin of life would be one um you know DNA sex eukaryotic system eukaryotic life um the endosymbiosis event or the archaeon 8 little bacteria you know just the whole thing and then of course emergence of Consciousness and so on so it seems like definitely there are sparse events where mass amount of progress was made but yeah it's kind of hard to pick one so you don't think humans are unique gotta ask you how many intelligent aliens civilizations do you think are out there and uh is there intelligence different or similar to ours yeah I've been preoccupied with this question quite a bit recently uh basically the for me Paradox and just thinking through and and the reason actually that I am very interested in uh the origin of life is fundamentally trying to understand how common it is that there are technological societies out there uh um in space and the more I study it the more I think that um uh there should be quite a few quite a lot why haven't we heard from them because I I agree with you it feels like I just don't see why what we did here on Earth is so difficult to do yeah and especially when you get into the details of it I used to think origin of life was very um it was this magical rare event but then you read books like for example McLean um uh the vital question a life ascending Etc and he really gets in and he really makes you believe that this is not that rare basic chemistry you have an active Earth and you have your alkaline Vents and you have lots of alkaline Waters mixing whether it's a devotion and you have your proton gradients and you have the little porous pockets of these alkaline vents that concentrate chemistry and um basically as he steps through all of these little pieces you start to understand that actually this is not that crazy you could see this happen on other systems um and he really takes you from just a geology to primitive life and he makes it feel like it's actually pretty plausible and also like the origin of life um didn't uh was actually fairly fast after formation of Earth um if I remember correctly just a few hundred million years or something like that after basically when it was possible life actually arose and so that makes me feel like that is not the constraint that is not the limiting variable and that life should actually be fairly common um and then it you know where the drop-offs are is very um is very interesting to think about I currently think that there's no major drop-offs basically and so there should be quite a lot of life and basically what it where that brings me to then is the only way to reconcile the fact that we haven't found anyone and so on is that um we just can't we can't see them we can't observe them just a quick brief comment Nick Lane and a lot of biologists I talked to they really seem to think that the jump from bacteria to more complex organisms is the hardest jump the eukaryotic glyphosis yeah which I don't I get it they're much more knowledgeable uh than me about like the intricacies of biology but that seems like crazy because how much how many single cell organisms are there like and how much time you have surely it's not that difficult like in a billion years it's not even that long of a time really just all these bacteria under constrained resources battling it out I'm sure they can invent more complex again I don't understand it's like how to move from a hello world program to like like invent a function or something like that I don't yeah I I so I don't yeah so I'm with you I just feel like I don't see any if the origin of life that would be my intuition that's the hardest thing but if that's not the hardest thing because it happens so quickly then it's got to be everywhere and yeah maybe we're just too dumb to see it well it's just we don't have really good mechanisms for seeing this life I mean uh by what how um so I'm not an expert just to preface this but just said it was I want to meet an expert on alien intelligence and how to communicate I'm very suspicious of our ability to to find these intelligences out there and to find these Earths like radio waves for example are are terrible uh their power\n",

      "drops off as basically one over R square uh so I remember reading that our current radio waves would not be uh the ones that we we are broadcasting would not be uh measurable by our devices today only like was it like one tenth of a light year away like not even basically tiny distance because you really need like a targeted transmission of massive power directed somewhere for this to be picked up on long distances and so I just think that our ability to measure is um is not amazing I think there's probably other civilizations out there and then the big question is why don't they build binomial probes and why don't they Interstellar travel across the entire galaxy and my current answer is it's probably Interstellar travel is like really hard uh you have the interstellar medium if you want to move at closer speed of light you're going to be encountering bullets along the way because even like tiny hydrogen atoms and little particles of dust are basically have like massive kinetic energy at those speeds and so basically you need some kind of shielding you need you have all the cosmic radiation uh it's just like brutal out there it's really hard and so my thinking is maybe Interstellar travel is just extremely hard to build hard it feels like uh it feels like we're not a billion years away from doing that it just might be that it's very you have to go very slowly potentially as an example through space um right as opposed to close the speed of light so I'm suspicious basically of our ability to measure life and I'm suspicious of the ability to um just permeate all of space in the Galaxy or across galaxies and that's the only way that I can certainly I can currently see a way around it yeah it's kind of mind-blowing to think that there's trillions of intelligent alien civilizations out there kind of slowly traveling through space to meet each other and some of them meet some of them go to war some of them collaborate or they're all just uh independent they are all just like little pockets I don't know well statistically if there's like if it's there's trillions of them surely some of them some of the pockets are close enough to get some of them happen to be close yeah in the close enough to see each other and then once you see once you see something that is definitely complex life like if we see something yeah we're probably going to be severe like intensely aggressively motivated to figure out what the hell that is and try to meet them what would be your first instinct to try to like at a generational level meet them or defend against them or what would be your uh Instinct as a president of the United States and the scientists I don't know which hat you prefer in this question yeah I think the the question it's really hard um I will say like for example for us um we have lots of primitive life forms on Earth um next to us we have all kinds of ants and everything else and we share space with them and we are hesitant to impact on them and to we are and we're trying to protect them by default because they are amazing interesting dynamical systems that took a long time to evolve and they are interesting and special and I don't know that you want to um destroy that by default and so I like complex dynamical systems that took a lot of time to evolve I think I'd like to I like to preserve it if I can afford to and I'd like to think that the same would be true about uh the galactic resources and that uh they would think that we're kind of incredible interesting story that took time it took a few billion years to unravel and you don't want to just destroy it I could see two aliens talking about Earth right now and saying uh I'm I'm a big fan of complex dynamical systems so I think it was a value to preserve these and who basically are a video game they watch or show a TV show that they watch yeah I think uh you would need like a very good reason I think to to destroy it uh like why don't we destroy these ant farms and so on it's because we're not actually like really in direct competition with them right now uh we do it accidentally and so on but um there's plenty of resources and so why would you destroy something that is so interesting and precious well from a scientific perspective you might probe it yeah you might interact with it later you might want to learn something from it right so I wonder there's could be certain physical phenomena that we think is a physical phenomena but it's actually interacting with us to like poke the finger and see what happens I think it should be very interesting to scientists other alien scientists what happened here um and you know it's a what we're seeing today is a snapshot basically it's a result of a huge amount of computation uh of over like billion years or something like that so it could have been initiated by aliens this could be a computer running a program like when okay if you had the power to do this when you okay for sure at least I would I would pick uh a Earth-like planet that has the\n",

      "just in the low earth orbit just gets cluttered and just the whole thing happens in the last two seconds and you're like this is exploding this is a statement explosion so if you play yeah yeah if you play it at normal speed yeah it'll just look like an explosion it's a firecracker we're living in a firecracker where it's going to start emitting all kinds of interesting things yeah and then so explosion doesn't it might actually look like a little explosion with with lights and fire and energy emitted all that kind of stuff but when you look inside the details of the explosion there's actual complexity happening where there's like uh yeah human life or some kind of life we hope it's not destructive firecracker it's kind of like a constructive uh firecracker all right so given that I think uh hilarious disgusting it is a really interesting to think about like what the puzzle of the universe is that the creator of the universe uh give us a message like for example in the book contact UM Carl Sagan uh there's a message for Humanity for any civilization in uh digits in the expansion of Pi and base 11 eventually which is kind of interesting thought uh maybe maybe we're supposed to be giving a message to our creator maybe we're supposed to somehow create some kind of a quantum mechanical system that alerts them to our intelligent presence here because if you think about it from their perspective it's just say like Quantum field Theory massive like cellular automaton like thing and like how do you even notice that we exist you might not even be able to pick us up in that simulation and so how do you uh how do you prove that you exist that you're intelligent and that you're a part of the universe so this is like a touring test for intelligence from Earth yeah the Creator is uh I mean maybe this is uh like trying to complete the next word in a sentence this is a complicated way of that like Earth is just is basically sending a message back yeah the puzzle is basically like alerting the Creator that we exist or maybe the puzzle is just to just break out of the system and just uh you know stick it to the Creator in some way uh basically like if you're playing a video game you can um you can somehow find an exploit and find a way to execute on the host machine in the arbitrary code there's some for example I believe someone got Mario a game of Mario to play Pong just by uh exploiting it and then um creating a basically writing writing code and being able to execute arbitrary code in the game and so maybe we should be maybe that's the puzzle is that we should be um uh find a way to exploit it so so I think like some of these synthetic ads will eventually find the universe to be some kind of a puzzle and then solve it in some way and that's kind of like the end game somehow do you often think about it as a as a simulation so as the universe being a kind of computation that has might have bugs and exploits yes yeah I think so is that what physics is essentially I think it's possible that physics has exploits and we should be trying to find them arranging some kind of a crazy quantum mechanical system that somehow gives you buffer overflow somehow gives you a rounding error and a floating Point uh yeah that's right and like more and more sophisticated exploits like those are jokes but that could be actually very close yeah we'll find some way to extract infinite energy for example when you train a reinforcement learning agents um and physical simulations and you ask them to say run quickly on the flat ground they'll end up doing all kinds of like weird things um in part of that optimization right they'll get on their back leg and they will slide across the floor and it's because of the optimization the enforcement learning optimization on that agent has figured out a way to extract infinite energy from the friction forces and basically their poor implementation and they found a way to generate infinite energy and just slide across the surface and it's not what you expected it's just a it's sort of like a perverse solution and so maybe we can find something like that maybe we can be that little dog in this physical simulation the the cracks or escapes the intended consequences of the physics that the Universe came up with we'll figure out some kind of shortcut to some weirdness yeah and then oh man but see the problem with that weirdness is the first person to discover the weirdness like sliding in the back legs that's all we're going to do yeah it's very quickly because everybody does that thing so like the the paper clip maximizer is a ridiculous idea but that very well you know could be what then we'll just uh we'll just all switch that because it's so fun well no person will Discover it I think by the way I think it's going to have to be uh some kind of a super intelligent AGI of a third generation like we're building the first generation AGI you know third generation yeah so the the Bootloader for an AI the that AI yeah will be a Bootloader for another\n",

      "it in that way in the paper and so I think they had an idea that there was more um than just the surface of just like oh we're just doing translation and here's a better architecture you're not just doing translation this is like a really cool differentiable optimizable efficient computer that you've proposed and maybe they didn't have all of that foresight but I think is really interesting isn't it funny sorry to interrupt that title is memeable that they went for such a profound idea they went with the I don't think anyone used that kind of title before right protection is all you need yeah it's like a meme or something exactly it's not funny that one like uh maybe if it was a more serious title it wouldn't have the impact honestly I yeah there is an element of me that honestly agrees with you and prefers it this way yes if it was two grand it would over promise and then under deliver potentially so you want to just uh meme your way to greatness that should be a t-shirt so you you tweeted the Transformers the Magnificent neural network architecture because it is a general purpose differentiable computer it is simultaneously expressive in the forward pass optimizable via back propagation gradient descent and efficient High parallelism compute graph can you discuss some of those details expressive optimizable efficient yeah for memory or or in general whatever comes to your heart you want to have a general purpose computer that you can train on arbitrary problems like say the task of next word prediction or detecting if there's a cat in the image or something like that and you want to train this computer so you want to set its weights and I think there's a number of design criteria that sort of overlap in the Transformer simultaneously that made it very successful and I think the authors were kind of uh deliberately trying to make this really powerful architecture and um so basically it's very powerful in the forward pass because it's able to express um very general computation as a sort of something that looks like message passing you have nodes and they all store vectors and these nodes get to basically look at each other and it's each other's vectors and they get to communicate and basically notes get to broadcast hey I'm looking for certain things and then other nodes get to broadcast hey these are the things I have those are the keys and the values so it's not just the tension yeah exactly Transformer is much more than just the attention component it's got many pieces architectural that went into it the residual connection of the way it's arranged there's a multi-layer perceptron in there the way it's stacked and so on um but basically there's a message passing scheme where nodes get to look at each other decide what's interesting and then update each other and uh so I think the um when you get to the details of it I think it's a very expressive function uh so it can express lots of different types of algorithms and forward paths not only that but the way it's designed with the residual connections layer normalizations the softmax attention and everything it's also optimizable this is a really big deal because there's lots of computers that are powerful that you can't optimize or they're not easy to optimize using the techniques that we have which is back propagation and gradient and send these are first order methods very simple optimizers really and so um you also need it to be optimizable um and then lastly you want it to run efficiently in the hardware our Hardware is a massive throughput machine like gpus they prefer lots of parallelism so you don't want to do lots of sequential operations you want to do a lot of operations serially and the Transformer is designed with that in mind as well and so it's designed for our hardware and it's designed to both be very expressive in a forward pass but also very optimizable in the backward pass and you said that uh the residual connections support a kind of ability to learn short algorithms fast them first and then gradually extend them longer during training yeah what's what's the idea of learning short algorithms right think of it as a so basically a Transformer is a series of uh blocks right and these blocks have attention and a little multi-layer perceptron and so you you go off into a block and you come back to this residual pathway and then you go off and you come back and then you have a number of layers arranged sequentially and so the way to look at it I think is because of the residual pathway in the backward path the gradients uh sort of flow along it uninterrupted because addition distributes the gradient equally to all of its branches so the gradient from the supervision at the top uh just floats directly to the first layer and the all the residual connections are arranged so that in the beginning during initialization they contribute nothing to the residual pathway um so what it kind of looks like is imagine the Transformer is kind of like a uh python uh function like a death and um you get to do various kinds of like lines of code say you have a hundred layers deep Transformer typically they would be much shorter say\n",

      "20. so if 20 lines of code then you can do something in them and so think of during the optimization basically what it looks like is first you optimize the first line of code and then the second line of code can kick in and the third line of code can and I kind of feel like because of the residual pathway and the Dynamics of the optimization you can sort of learn a very short algorithm that gets the approximate tensor but then the other layers can sort of kick in and start to create a contribution and at the end of it you're you're optimizing over an algorithm that is 20 lines of code except these lines of code are very complex because it's an entire block of a transformer you can do a lot in there what's really interesting is that this Transformer architecture actually has been a remarkably resilient basically the Transformer that came out in 2016 is the Transformer you would use today except you reshuffle some of the layer norms the layer normalizations have been reshuffled to a pre-norm formulation and so it's been remarkably stable but there's a lot of bells and whistles that people have attached on and try to uh improve it I do think that basically it's a it's a big step in simultaneously optimizing for lots of properties of a desirable neural network architecture and I think people have been trying to change it but it's proven remarkably resilient but I do think that there should be even better architectures potentially but it's uh your you admire the resilience here yeah there's something profound about this architecture that that at least so maybe we can everything can be turned into a uh into a problem that Transformers can solve currently definitely looks like the Transformers taking over Ai and you can feed basically arbitrary problems into it and it's a general differentiable computer and it's extremely powerful and uh this convergence in AI has been really interesting to watch uh for me personally what else do you think could be discovered here about Transformers like what's surprising thing or or is it a stable um I went to stable place is there something interesting we might discover about Transformers like aha moments maybe has to do with memory uh maybe knowledge representation that kind of stuff definitely the Zeitgeist today is just pushing like basically right now this ad guys is do not touch the Transformer touch everything else yes so people are scaling up the data sets making them much much bigger they're working on the evaluation making the evaluation much much bigger and uh um they're basically keeping the architecture unchanged and that's how we've um that's the last five years of progress in AI kind of what do you think about one flavor of it which is language models have you been surprised uh has your sort of imagination been captivated by you mentioned GPT and all the bigger and bigger and bigger language models and uh what are the limits of those models do you think so just let the task of natural language basically the way GPT is trained right is you just download a mass amount of text Data from the internet and you try to predict the next word in a sequence roughly speaking you're predicting will work chunks but uh roughly speaking that's it and what's been really interesting to watch is uh basically it's a language model language models have actually existed for a very long time um there's papers on language modeling from 2003 even earlier can you explain that case what a language model is uh yeah so language model just basically the rough idea is um just predicting the next word in a sequence roughly speaking uh so there's a paper from for example bengio and the team from 2003 where for the first time they were using a neural network to take say like three or five words and predict the um next word and they're doing this on much smaller data sets and the neural net is not a Transformer it's a multiple error perceptron but but it's the first time that a neural network has been applied in that setting but even before neural networks there were language models except they were using engram models so engram models are just a count based models so um if you try to if you start to take two words and predict the third one you just count up how many times you've seen any two word combinations and what came next and what you predict that's coming next is just what you've seen the most of in the training set and so language modeling has been around for a long time neural networks have done language modeling for a long time so really what's new or interesting or exciting is just realizing that when you scale it up with a powerful enough neural net Transformer you have all these emergent properties where basically what happens is if you have a large enough data set of text you are in the task of predicting the next word you are multitasking a huge amount of different kinds of problems you are multitasking understanding of you know chemistry physics human nature lots of things are sort of clustered in that objective it's a very simple objective but actually you have to understand a lot about the world to make that prediction you just said the U word understanding uh are you in terms of chemistry and\n",
